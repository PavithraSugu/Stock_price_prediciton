# Stock_price_prediciton
Project Description : 
      In this applied data science project, we have undertaken the task of stock price prediction using historical data from Microsoft Corporation (MSFT). The project encompasses a series of essential steps to 
leverage machine learning techniques for forecasting stock prices. It begins with data acquisition, where we source historical MSFT stock price data and preprocess it, including addressing data outliers and missing 
values. We then split the dataset into training and testing sets, reserving 80% for model training and 20% for evaluation. To enhance the model's predictive capacity, we employ Min-Max scaling for data normalization.
The heart of the project lies in constructing and training a deep learning model, utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, known for their effectiveness in time series analysis. The model architecture
comprises multiple LSTM layers with dropout for regularization and a final output layer. After model training, we evaluate its performance, calculating metrics like mean squared error and mean absolute error. 
Finally, the trained model is used to make future stock price predictions on unseen data, and the results are inverse-transformed to obtain actual price values. This project offers valuable insights into the 
potential for applying data science techniques to predict financial trends and make informed investment decisions based on Microsoft's stock price history.

Dataset Description : 
      The Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) dataset is a comprehensive collection of historical stock price information, offering a valuable resource for financial analysis and investment research. This dataset 
encompasses a time span dating back to 1986, providing a long-term perspective on the performance of Microsoft's publicly traded shares. It includes a wide range of data attributes, with the 'Close' price being a 
focal point for investors and analysts, capturing the daily closing price of MSFT stock over several decades. The dataset, which has been meticulously curated and prepared for analysis, is an essential tool for 
understanding the trends, fluctuations, and growth patterns of one of the world's leading technology companies. Researchers and market enthusiasts can employ this dataset to study Microsoft's stock price history, 
conduct time series analysis, and develop predictive models that can aid in making informed investment decisions or gain insights into the company's financial performance over time.
